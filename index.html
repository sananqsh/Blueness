		<p>We don`t claim that this life is a gift and we should appriciate it
		and others must be the same as we know only little of this world and
		life and death.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here we only try to help friends to decide in peace... No one knows which
			descision is better. Many of our employees haven`t even been near to 
			conditions that drive some people to a place that end their lives.
		</p>
		<p>
			All we know is that we all eventually ARE gonna experience that point that
			our life ends, and this world is sooo big and full of things to see, listen,
			smell, feel and learn about... For ones who still want to reach a beam of hope
			in this world, a shelter is always provided here, 
			and for those who made up their mind to leave us, also a safe passage...
		</p>
		<p>
			We assure you of every evidence that this institution spares no pain keeping
			these people with us.
			But afterall,<b> everything of a man belongs to him and
			no one else; his descisions are no exempt of this.</b>
