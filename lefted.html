					"He was a troubled kid. We never really found out what happened to him. It still puzzles me when I think about it." Says his doctor.<br>
					All we knew of him was that he was a bartender at BadWeather and his specialty drink was the "Shirley Templar". But actually there wasn`t any issue about his descisions.<br> Our doctors say he only came to us to hide from some people... But we never had someone asking for him.
					He checked out in July 19, 2012 and soon after we couldn`t contact him.<br>
					After some investigation his actual name turned out to be Desmond Miles after he used his finger print to purchase a motorcycle. His neighbours say he disappeared soon after that.

					Approached us with a lot of love and hope in her eyes. His boyfriend came with him eventhough he didn`t have issues with his "journey in life" to support her as her birthday gift.<br>They signed up together on Amanda`s 18th birthday; but through the passage of time they took different paths as Amanda was becoming more and more sure of her descision.<br>Finally on a rainy Sunday, Amanda chose us to give her a safe and painless passage to her afterlife. Thanks to her, an 8 year old boy has a healthier heart inside his body. Little Anthony now works on our chemical Labs.
